## What I Did:

### 1. **Data Import**

### 2. **Visual Comparison**
- Built visual comparisons of investment preferences by gender.
- Plotted the **number of investors** in Equity Market, Government Bonds, and Mutual Funds.
  - Males: 25 investors in each category.
  - Females: 15 investors in each category.
- Visualized the **sum of investment amount** by gender and category using a stacked column chart.
  - Males: 
    - Equity Market: 89 (32.84%)
    - Mutual Funds: 61 (22.51%)
    - Government Bonds: 121 (44.65%)
  - Females: 
    - Equity Market: 50 (32.05%)
    - Mutual Funds: 41 (26.28%)
    - Government Bonds: 65 (41.67%)

### 3. **Key Insights**
- Total of **40 individuals** analyzed: 25 males and 15 females.
- **Government Bonds** make up the largest share of investment for both genders.
- Males have a slightly higher share in Equity Market than females.
- Females invest relatively more proportionally in Mutual Funds than males.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
Created an interactive dashboard using:
- **Bar Chart:** Number of investors by gender and investment type.
- **Stacked Column Chart:** Share of investment amount by gender and category.
- **Cards:** Displaying total investors and gender split.
