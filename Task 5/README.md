  - Assured Returns: 26
  - Better Returns: 24

  - Fixed Returns: 18
  - Fund Diversification, Safe Investment, and others

- Implemented **slicers** to filter reasons based on:
  - Equity
  - Mutual Fund
  - Bonds
  - Fixed Deposits

### 3. **Key Insights**
- **Capital Appreciation** was the most cited reason (30 responses).
- Followed by:
  - **Assured Returns** (26 responses)
