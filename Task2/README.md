## What I Did:

### 1. **Data Import**
- Imported the cleaned investment dataset into **Power BI** for gender-wise analysis.

### 2. **Visual Comparison**
- Created clear charts comparing **investment choices** (Equity Market, Government Bonds, Mutual Funds) by gender.
- Compared the **number of investors** in each investment option for males and females.
- Visualized the **total investment amount** by gender for each investment option using a stacked column chart.

### 3. **Calculated Key Insights**
- **Investor Count:** Males have 25 investors in each category; Females have 15 in each.
- **Investment Allocation:**  
  - Males allocate the highest share to **Equity Market** (32.84%) and a smaller share to Mutual Funds.
  - Females also prefer **Equity Market** (32.05%) but invest a relatively higher proportion in **Mutual Funds** (26.28%).
- Identified gender-based investment trends and significant differences.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
Used multiple visuals for better understanding:
- **Bar Chart:** To show number of investors in each investment avenue by gender.
- **Stacked Column Chart:** To show percentage share of investment amount by category and gender.
- **Cards:** To display total number of male and female investors for quick snapshot.
